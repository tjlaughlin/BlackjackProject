## BlackJack project
- This is my week 4 project and it is a program to run a Black Jack game. The program utilizes OOP, encapsulation and and utilizes enums to create the cards.

## Topics
- Enums
- object oriented programming
- using eclipse's debugger feature
- instantiation of objects
- superclass
## Lessons Learned
- this weeks project incorporated a lot of of what object oriented programming entails. Using objects prior to this week was tough for me. It was hard trying to put things into english and then translating them to code.
- Having to incorporate the objects and think logically was helpful this week. "has a" or "is a" was something that came up a lot. Having to think through what a dealer has, or what a player has was helpful to practice OOP.


## How to Run

- The project begins by asking if you would like to play the game. if the player choses es then the game deals cards to both the player and the dealer. The dealer only shows one card in his hand just like the real game.
- After viewing your cards the player is asked whether they would like to hit or not.
- if yes then the program runs through the game until the4 player either busts, stands or has a black Jack
 - if the player stands the dealer shows his hand and if it is below the value of 17 the dealer has to hit. if it is above 17 the dealer stays and whoever has the highest value hand wins the game

## Long term stretch goals/things i need to work on
 - long stretch goals: need to put the entire game into a loop
 - add some ascii art
 - clean up the conditional statements for the game
 - maybe put the conditional statements into a method?

 - will be continuing to work on this one as it was pretty fun!!
